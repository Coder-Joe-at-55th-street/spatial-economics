# spatial-economics
The home of all code for the Oeconomica Spatial Economics cohort for 2019â€“2020.

# Data managment and setting up your R project
All data used in this project will be kept in a Google Drive folder. Please make sure you sync this Google Drive folder (`Spatial Economics Cohort (Shared Folder)`) to your computer.

We are now going to do a couple things to set up GitHub with R:
- Open RStudio, and create a new project (specifically, create a new directory)
  - Name the new directory `spatial-economics`
  - Create the project as a subdirectory of the `spatial-economics` folder we already have downloaded
  - Make sure "Create a git repository" is not checked
- In your new R project, create a file called: `data.R`
  - In this file, put the line of code equivalent to: `ddir <- "/Users/gelkouh/Google Drive (UChicago)/Spatial Economics Cohort (Shared Folder)/Cohort Research Paper/Data"` 
  - (note: you may need to begin the file path in your code with `C:` if you are not using a Mac)
  - Save it in the same folder as the project your just created
  
The `data.R` file will allow us to write code that is system agnostic: in other words it can call a standard file (`data.R`) that we will have on all our machines and then we will have an object called ddir in our R environment which can be used to tell our computer where to look for data. 

(thank you to ekarsten for some of this)
